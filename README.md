# Warri Initiative

* .NET Core & Vue.js website (in progress)
* End goal to create a platform to facilitate building relationships between developers in Warri, Nigeria and developers here in the United States.
* Planning to implement a donation platform to raise funds for dev-related supplies for the Warri-based developer group, and to eventually raise enough to build a co-working hub that the group can use for learning, collaboration, and mentorship.
